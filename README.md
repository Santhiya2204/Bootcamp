# Bootcamp
This repository contains essential resources and code developed during the BOOTCAMP. The main components include:
Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb): These notebooks contain step-by-step implementations of various data analysis, machine learning, and programming tasks covered in the bootcamp. Each notebook includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and visualizations to aid learning.
CSV Files (.csv): These datasets are used for analysis and machine learning model training. They include structured data that can be processed and visualized using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
